# Bubble Sort in Java

This is a basic implementation of the Bubble Sort algorithm in Java. Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.

# Usage

1. Open the project in your preferred Java development environment.

2. Modify the main method in the BubbleSort class to use your own array of numbers.

3. Run the program.
